Get things organized with these powerful, yet easy to use sets. The first set implemented in 0.1.0 is `Sequence`. 
From a generic perspective, sequences are ordered sets of elements, with each element at a unique position. `Sequence` allows 
to add and remove elements at any position, virtually infinitely.

At first, a `Vec<T>` looks most appropriate for implementing a sequence. However, when thinking about persisting the sequence, 
there are some challenges in practice:

- How to store a sequence in a database and retrieve it efficiently?
- How to add elements to a sequence at an arbitrary position efficiently, e.g. without having to change the position of all following elements?
- How to change the position of a single element without the need to change other elements' positions?
- How to avoid the need to rebalance the sequence, i.e. having to rewrite the position of all elements?
- How to scale the approach to hundreds of thousands of operations on the sequence, such as adding, moving and removing elements?

The objective of `kodiak-sets` implementation of `Sequence` is to solve these challenges. In 0.1.0 it only offers support for `Sequence`. 
In the future, other types of sets might be added.

We use the "mediant fraction" algorithm to define a position within a `Sequence`. The mediant fraction is a mathematical concept 
that has been known and used for a long time. It is a method of finding a fraction that lies between two given fractions by 
taking the sum of the numerators and denominators separately.

The crate is a building block of the Kodiak project, thus the naming of the crate. Kodiak supports sequences of entities at a very large scale. 
However, the functionality provided by `kodiak-sets` is useful on its own and might be of interest for other projects as well. 
That's why we deliver it as a separate crate. So, feel free to use it. If you consider using `kodiak-sets` in your project but are missing 
something or have any other concerns, don't hesitate to file an issue on GitHub.

We are looking forward to your feedback.

# Impressions

todo: show two examples of sequences supported by `kodiak-sets`.

Provide additional examples in EXAMPLES.md and link to it.

Demonstrate capabilities!

# Known issues / limitations
- üèóÔ∏è Version 0.1.0 does not yet power other projects, so API has not yet proven it's power in practice.
- üöß Code is fully covered by unit tests, however, some integration tests are still missing.
- Documentation has still _some_ room for improvement.
- üêß Version 0.1.x is developed and tested on Linux only.

# Roadmap and future considerations

## Version 0.4.0 (planned)
- Example showing how to use this library with MySQL.

## Version 0.3.0 (planned)
- Example showing how to use this library with PostgreSQL.

## Version 0.2.0 (planned)
- Support iterators for `Sequence`
- Support the trait `Clone`

## Version 0.1.0 (delivered)
- Initial release.
- Examples to demonstrate the power of fraction based positioning.
- Examples showing how to use this library with SQlite.
